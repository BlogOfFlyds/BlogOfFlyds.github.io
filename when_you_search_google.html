		<h1>What happens when you search google</h1>
		<br>
		<p>When you type in the words and click enter, the server starts searching webpages with the keyword that you typed in. That is called crawling. When the server finds a webpage with a match of the keywords, it stores the webpage. This is called indexing. Once it has a good number of websites it orders the results by relevance. The website was most relevant would appear at the top of the list. All of this happens in seconds.</p>
